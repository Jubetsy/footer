##In this code:

We use display: grid on the .container to set up a CSS Grid layout.
The .container holds both the background image and the text container.
The background image is set to cover the entire container and is positioned absolutely to ensure it's behind the text.
The text container is positioned relative, so it respects the centering of its parent container and can be easily centered using text-align: center. It's given a higher z-index than the background image to ensure it appears on top.
Replace "background.svg" with the path to your SVG background image. Make sure your SVG is properly sized and set up to work as a background image.
